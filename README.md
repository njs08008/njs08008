## <div align="center">Welcome to my GitHub!</div>

I studied number theory in graduate school all will always think of myself as a mathematician, but now I work in data!
In my career I would like to become proficient in all aspects of the data ecosystem: querying, statistical analysis, reporting, ETL pipelines, machine learning, and more.
I'm no software developer, but some of these areas tend to bump right up on it, so why not have a GitHub??

Not all of the work I do makes sense to include here, and most of what I do is proprietary, but once in a blue moon I'll update this.
Despite the spareness of my repos,  you can still find a few good examples here!
- [Object Oriented Programming in Python](https://github.com/njs08008/miscelaneous/blob/master/tic_tac_toe_class.py)
- [Procedural Programming in Python](https://github.com/njs08008/miscelaneous/blob/master/tic_tac_toe_procedural.py)
- [Clusting in a Python Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/njs08008/Springboard/blob/master/machine_learning/Mini_Project_Clustering.ipynb)
